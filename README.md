# Portfolio

Welcome to my **Personal Portfolio**! 🎉 Built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, this site showcases my skills, projects, and professional journey in a visually appealing and responsive design.

Live Site: [portfolio](https://nehasaleemdesai.github.io/portfolio/)

## Purpose

This project was initiated as a **boosted response** to the realities of job searching. With every application I sent out, portfolios became a requirement — so what better way to stand out than to **create my own?** 😎 This portfolio serves as both my **digital resume** and a creative expression of who I am and what I can do.

It’s my space to showcase the projects I’ve worked on, my technical skills, and all the work I’m proud of. Not only does it help employers find me, but it also gives me a chance to prove I know how to code and build something from scratch (hint: I do!). 🙌

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The portfolio looks great on all devices, so you can browse it on mobile, tablet, or desktop.
- **Smooth Scrolling & Navigation**: A seamless navigation experience that makes it easier to move through the portfolio.
- **Flower Grid**: Because life is too short for dull designs, I added a beautiful flower grid (thanks to a **genius article**). 🌸

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure and content of the website.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout (with responsive design and some fun touches).
- **JavaScript**: Used for interactive features such as smooth scrolling.

## Credits

A special shout-out to [Munim Iftikhar](https://munimiftikhar.medium.com/learn-to-create-flowers-grid-in-css-6cf8772b8fc5) for their amazing article on creating flower grids in CSS. I used it to add a unique, lively touch to the design of my portfolio. 🌸🌸🌸

## Note

Some designs and layouts were **trial-and-error** attempts (gotta love the process of iteration, right?), and I’ve commented them out for **personal use**. They’re irrelevant to the public and are just part of my journey. So if you see any commented-out code, don’t worry — it’s not for you, it’s for me. 😏

## Getting Started

Feel free to view my portfolio in all its glory, but please **don’t clone it**. This is my personal showcase, and I’d like to keep it that way. But hey, feel free to check out the structure and get inspired if you’re building your own! 🙌
